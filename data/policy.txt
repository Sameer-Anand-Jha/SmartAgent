Authentication is performed using a token based mechanism.
Tokens expire after 24 hours and must be refreshed after expiration.
Failed authentication attempts must be logged for auditing purposes.
Sensitive operations require role based access control.
Unauthenticated or unauthorized requests must be rejected immediately.
