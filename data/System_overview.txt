System Overview

The system is a real time conversational voice agent.
Voice Activity Detection is used to detect when the user starts speaking.
Short acknowledgement phrases such as yeah or okay are treated as backchannels.
Backchannels do not interrupt the agent while it is speaking.
Explicit interruption commands such as stop or wait immediately stop agent speech.
Knowledge based questions are answered using document retrieval and generation.
